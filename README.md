# PureScript Source maps test

Simple setups showing end to end source maps with webpack and browserify. These are basically
various ways of building a PureScript projet while avoiding `psc-bundle`, which does not
support source maps at this time.

Works with `psc` as of [0.8.1](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/releases/tag/v0.8.1)/0.8.2

### Build everything

The `package.json` for this project contains some run scripts to build with browserify and webpack preserving
source maps.

Usage:
```
bower install && npm install

npm run -s build-all
http-server
```

(You can use any http server to serve the project root directory: [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
is one such that can be installed with npm (`npm install -g http-server`)).

### webpack

Usage:
```
bower install && npm install
npm install -g webpack-dev-server

pulp build --source-maps
webpack-dev-server
```

(or see build scripts/build-all above).

### webpack (purescript webpack plugin)

The standard `purs-loader`/`purescript-webpack-plugin` setup (as generated by `pulp server`, for example)
cannot support source maps as `psc-bundle` is used. @ethul has added support to skip
bundling and has an example of generating source maps:
[purescript-webpack-example](https://github.com/ethul/purescript-webpack-example).

### Browserify

It's possible to do the same with browserify, but browserify does not in itself
combine source maps from its own process with input source maps. One option is to
use [sorcery](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/sorcery) to glue purescript and browserify
source maps together.

Usage:
```
bower install && npm install

pulp build --source-maps
browserify --debug .browserify.js -o browserify.js
sorcery -i browserify.js

http-server
```

### Direct CommonJS

When using PureScript code directly as CommonJS modules, such as in Node or Electron,
source maps can be used directly with no additional tooling.
